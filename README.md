# React App: MyReads Book Tracking App

## Project Information

### About

This web application uses React to compose a single-page application that keeps tracks of a user's book list. The user can sort their books onto different shelves, search for new books to add to their shelves, and manage books between shelves. This project was for my Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

### Concepts

The primary technologies used in the development of this app were:

- React to construct the UI, handle state changes, and store methods and properties to manage the site
- An external BooksAPI to provide a backend for the handful of books a user could search for and add
- React Router to manage the apps locations between the main page and the search page
- Promises & asynchronous Javascript to handle update requests for the books catalog

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Do note, search queries are limited to a very select number of search entries. A list of these entries can be found [here](https://github.com/raicalvin/fend-p7-myreads-book-tracking-react-app/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md).

### Downloading

Download the application, which includes the app files as well as a back-end server, using the following Git command:

```
git clone https://github.com/raicalvin/fend-p7-myreads-book-tracking-react-app.git
```

### Installing

If the proper npm modules have not been installed, use the following command to install them into the app folder:

```
npm install
```

### Running

To start the back-end server and the application, CD into the app folder and run the following command in the terminal:

```
npm start
```
